# How to use this skeleton

* To keep things simple, we have created a single maven project, which contains the client-side and the server side code.

* For this reason, there are two classes with a `main` method: `CaesarClient` and `CaesarServer`.

* If you want to share constants and code between the client and the server, then it is probably a good idea to put in the `protocol` package.

* There are two scripts to start the client, respectively the server. You can invoke these scripts after the building the project with `mvn clean install`.
